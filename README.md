# Inkpens 0.8.2.90

I have decided to release Inkpens 0.8.2.90. If you didn't know, Inkpens is a terminal-based note taking app coded in Kotlin. There are two versions: exe or jar. I would recommend exe,
but it's completely up to you. I hope to be able to release the full version next year. This, even though it is a little clumsy, can run in Git Bash. Apart from that, you can run it
in PowerShell and CMD.

# CMD Tutorial

Obviously, install it. Save it to a directory you will remember.

1. Go to CMD and cd to your directory where your installation files are.
2. Type .\userinstall.bat
3. After it finishes, do java -jar ink.jar.
4. Should run!

# PowerShell Tutorial

Same thing as CMD lol

# EXE Tutorial

1. Install it
2. Double click the exe.
3. Done!
